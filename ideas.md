- **Real-time code quality metrics** showing complexity, maintainability, and performance scores
- **Intelligent refactoring recommendations** with before/after previews
- **Security vulnerability scanning** integrated into the workflow
- **Performance optimization suggestions** with impact analysis

### 2. Interactive & Collaborative Features
- **Live code editor** with real-time syntax highlighting and error detection
- **Side-by-side code comparison** for refactoring and optimization
- **Interactive code visualization** showing data flow and dependencies
- **Collaborative workspace** for team coding sessions
- **Code snippet library** with custom templates and organization

### 3. Advanced Debugging & Testing
- **Intelligent bug detection** with root cause analysis
